\section{Getting initial versions}
There is only one real program in this directory, \verb"get_initial_versions/download.py". This was initially written to get all routes in Romania created by Lightcyphers -- there were some issues that had to be resolved.

This also requires editing. You will (minimally) need to change the query and users at the bottom of the file.
